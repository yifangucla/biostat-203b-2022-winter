```{r setup, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
```
During the lecture, we learned how to replace the first match:
For example, we replace the first match of vowel.
    ```{r}
    x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
    str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
    ```
We also learned how to replace all matches:
    ```{r}
    str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
    ```

There is a question of how can we only replace the second match.
And I find out the answer:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
y <- str_extract(x, "([aeiou].*?[aeiou])") %>%
  str_replace( ".$", "-") 
str_replace(x, "([aeiou].*?[aeiou])", y)
```
